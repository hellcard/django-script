# django-script

Simple bash script to create a django project.

### how to launch?

First you need to download it, put it in the directory where you plan to create a Django project, and make the script executable using the following command:

$ chmod +x django_script

then run with the following command:

$ ./django_script

## WARNING: For the script to work correctly, you must enter the names of the requested variables, otherwise the project structure will not launch the original Django site
If you don't enter the names of the variables you're asking for and ignore them, the structure of your Django project will suffer
